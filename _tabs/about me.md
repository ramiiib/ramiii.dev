# Hi there!

Welcome to my cybersec blog! I‚Äôm an aspiring security researcher currently working in Managed Detection and Response (MDR), with a background in software programming. My passion for cybersecurity began in high school, when I would love to watch video essays about high-profile cyberattacks and other general cybercrime (still do). I'll be using this blog to share any projects, research, or cool things I learn about as I continue to grow in the cybersecurity industry.
