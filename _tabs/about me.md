# Hi there!

Welcome to my cyber security blog where I'll be building projects (and my skills). Currently studying a Bachelor of IT majoring in Software Technology at Macquarie University. But ever since I joined uni, I've looked into the cyber sec world more and more and started to really enjoy learning about it. Since then, I'm now hoping to turn this passion for cyber sec into my career and will be documenting my journey with this blog post right here!
